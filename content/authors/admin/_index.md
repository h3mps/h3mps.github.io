## About Me

Welcome to my site!

My research interests are in urban, real estate, public and environmental economics. My work applies cutting-edge empirical approaches to a variety of policy relevant questions. I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Alberta in the Department of Resource Economics and Environmental Sociology (REES) and am part of the Bridging Divides U of A team.
