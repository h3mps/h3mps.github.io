abstract: Greenbelts are a widespread policy tool used to protect natural spaces from
  urban sprawl. With rising housing costs in many metropolitan areas, numerous questions
  have been raised about the impact of greenbelts on housing markets. In this paper,
  I evaluate the impact that the introduction of the world’s largest contiguous greenbelt,
  which was formed around Toronto in the early-2000s, had on housing prices across
  the region. To capture the key dynamics of a greenbelt, I develop an estimable model
  of the housing market with heterogeneous supply elasticities and a nested logit
  demand system. Using rich transaction and project-level data on housing prices and
  developments from 2000-2010, I estimate housing supply and demand curves separately,
  where I address the endogeneity of housing prices with instrumental variables. Using
  the estimated model, I find that the Greenbelt led to an average increase in housing
  costs of 2.9% by 2010. Although non-trivial (C$600 a year in rent), this increase
  accounts for only 4% of the increase in prices during this period, suggesting that
  the Greenbelt does not explain much of the deterioration in housing affordability.
  Skyrocketing housing costs can instead be explained by the fact that strong housing
  demand within the urban footprint is met with highly inelastic housing supply.
