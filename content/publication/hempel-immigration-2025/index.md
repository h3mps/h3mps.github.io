abstract: As immigration becomes the primary driver of population growth in many countries,
  concerns persist regarding its implications for public finances. This paper examines
  the fiscal impact of immigration at the municipal level in Canada between 2004 and
  2022, leveraging high-quality annual immigration data and a shift-share instrumental
  variables (IV) approach. We find that immigration increases municipal revenues and
  leads to improved municipal budget balances, which holds even for low-skilled immigrants.
  These results contrast with recent evidence from the United States, which highlights
  substantial heterogeneity across immigrant skill groups. We argue that low-skill
  immigrants to Canada are in fact net fiscal contributors in the municipal context,
  due to the more complex interactions between municipal budgets and the skill distribution.
